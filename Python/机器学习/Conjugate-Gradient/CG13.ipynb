    "If $A$ is square and nonsingular, the solution to Equation 55 is the solution to $Ax=b$. If $A$ is not square, and $Ax=b$ is *overconstrained* — that is, has more linearly independent equations than variables — then there may or may not be a solution to $Ax=b$, but it is always possible to find a value of that minimizes Expression 54, the sum of the squares of the errors of each linear equation.\n",

    "$A^TA$ is symmetric and positive (for any $x, x^TA^TAx = \\|Ax\\|^2 \\geq 0$). If is not underconstrained, then $A^TA$ is nonsingular, and methods like Steepest Descent and CG can be used to solve Equation 55. The only nuisance in doing so is that the condition number of $ATA$ is the square of that of $A$, so convergence is significantly slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important technical point is that the matrix $A^TA$ is never formed explicitly, because it is less sparse than $A$. Instead, $A^TA$ is multiplied by $d$ by first finding the product $Ad$, and then $A^TAd$. Also, numerical stability is improved if the value $d^T A^T A d$ (in Equation 46) is computed by taking the inner product of $Ad$ with itself."
