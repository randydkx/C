    "Conjugate Direction methods were probably first presented by Schmidt [14] in 1908, and were independently reinvented by Fox, Huskey, and Wilkinson [7] in 1948. In the early fifties, the method of Conjugate Gradients was discovered independently by Hestenes [10] and Stiefel [15]; shortly thereafter, they jointly published what is considered the seminal reference on CG [11]. Convergence bounds for CG in terms of Chebyshev polynomials were developed by Kaniel [12]. A more thorough analysis of CG convergence is provided by van der Sluis and van der Vorst [16]. CG was popularized as an iterative method for large, sparse matrices by Reid [13] in 1971.\n",
    "\n",
    "CG was generalized to nonlinear problems in 1964 by Fletcher and Reeves [6], based on work by Davidon [4] and Fletcher and Powell [5]. Convergence of nonlinear CG with inexact line searches was analyzed by Daniel [3]. The choice of for nonlinear CG is discussed by Gilbert and Nocedal [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "A history and extensive annotated bibliography of CG to the mid-seventies is provided by Golub and O’Leary [9]. Most research since that time has focused on nonsymmetric systems. A survey of iterative methods for the solution of linear systems is offered by Barrett et al. [1]."
