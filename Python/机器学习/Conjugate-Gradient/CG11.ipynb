    "Thereâ€™s not much to say about starting. If you have a rough estimate of the value of $x$, use it as the starting value $x_{[0]}$. If not, set $x_{[0]} = 0$; either Steepest Descent or CG will eventually converge when used to solve linear systems. Nonlinear minimization (coming up in Section 14) is trickier, though, because there may be several local minima, and the choice of starting point will determine which minimum the procedure converges to, or whether it will converge at all."
